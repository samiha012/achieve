          We began with a simple question: <span className="italic">What if exams could help you grow, not just grade you?</span> Frustrated by slow, outdated systems and a lack of meaningful feedback, we set out to build a platform where every student could see their progress, understand their mistakes, and be celebrated for their achievements.

        <p className="text-lg md:text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Today, our portal empowers thousands of students to learn smarter, track their growth, and earn real rewards for their dedication. This is more than an exam systemâ€”it's your partner in success.
